**Today's Progress**: Started on the second Responsive Web Design Project - Making a Survery Form.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle with forms in HTML and especially how to style them. That's the reason I started with this challenge on freeCodeCamp. The plan is to finish and get hold of the Front-End Certificate so I can get on with the JS one.
